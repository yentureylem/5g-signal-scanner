**Interactive RSSI/SINR dashboard with 5G coverage prediction and throughput estimation.**

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates a simplified 5G cellular link and visualizes **signal quality**, **coverage**, and **throughput** in an interactive Streamlit web app.  
The goal is to demonstrate **cellular engineering intuition** (RSSI, SINR, path loss, coverage maps) in a clean, browser-based tool – ideal for a **cellular engineering / modem / RF internship**.

Key ideas:

- Map **RSSI / SINR / distance** sliders to a realistic **path loss** model.
- Use a simplified **Okumura–Hata-like** formula to estimate **received power** over distance.  
- Visualize a **coverage heatmap** and **SINR vs throughput** curve to highlight performance trade-offs.

## ✨ Features

- **Signal Control Panel (sidebar)**
  - Adjust **RSSI (dBm)**, **SINR (dB)**, and **distance (km)** interactively.
  - Updates all KPIs and plots in real-time.

- **Key KPIs**
  - RSSI, SINR, distance displayed with **status badges** (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent).
  - Predicted **Rx power (dBm)** and qualitative **link quality**.

- **5G Coverage Heatmap**
  - Synthetic cell centered in a 2D area (lat–lon style grid).
  - Signal power estimated using a distance-based path loss model.
  - Color-coded map (green = strong coverage, red = weak).

- **Throughput vs SINR Curve**
  - Smooth, saturating curve approximating 5G throughput as a function of SINR.
  - Vertical line showing **current SINR** and estimated throughput (Mbps).

- **Fully web-based**
  - Deployable on Streamlit Community Cloud.
  - No hardware or SDR required; pure simulation with NumPy/SciPy.

## 🧠 Technical Details

### Path Loss & Coverage

The app approximates path loss for an urban macro cell:

- Center frequency around **3.5 GHz** (typical 5G NR band).  
- Distance-dependent path loss inspired by **Okumura–Hata**:  

\[
PL(d) \approx A(fc, h_t, h_r) + B(h_t)\log_{10}(d)
\]

- Transmit power is fixed; predicted **Rx power** (in dBm) is:

\[
P_{rx} \approx P_{tx} - PL(d)
\]

- Link quality is categorized by Rx power thresholds (e.g. > −80 dBm = “Excellent”, < −100 dBm = “Poor”).

The 2D coverage heatmap is generated by:

- Building a mesh grid around the base station.
- Computing distance from each grid point to the cell center.
- Applying the same path loss formula to obtain a **power map**.

### Throughput vs SINR

Throughput is computed as a smooth, saturating function of SINR:

- Low SINR → near 0 Mbps.  
- Moderate SINR → rapidly increasing throughput.  
- High SINR → saturation around a target (e.g. 100 Mbps).

Implementation uses an error-function–like nonlinearity to mimic **capacity curves** qualitatively.
